Postmortem: Outage in Airbnb Clone Application

Root Cause:

The outage was caused by a misconfigured Nginx load balancer, which failed to distribute traffic evenly across backend servers, directing all traffic to a single server that eventually crashed.
Timeline
Issue Detected: Monitoring systems identified a spike in error rates and slow server response times.
Initial Investigation: The on-call engineer began by checking backend servers, suspecting an overload or memory leak.
Misleading Path: Assumed the issue was due to high user activity, leading to server restarts that did not resolve the problem.
Escalation: The issue was escalated to the DevOps team when the problem persisted after server restarts.
Root Cause Identified: The team discovered that the Nginx load balancer was improperly configured, sending all traffic to a single server.
Resolution: The load balancer configuration was corrected to evenly distribute traffic, restoring the application to normal.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The problem stemmed from a recent misconfiguration of the Nginx load balancer. Instead of distributing incoming traffic evenly across multiple backend servers, it funneled all traffic to one server, causing it to become overloaded and unresponsive.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by updating the Nginx load balancer configuration to correctly distribute traffic among all backend servers, allowing the application to return to normal operations.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

Implement stricter configuration management and review processes to prevent misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring to detect unbalanced traffic distribution earlier.
Tasks:

Patch Nginx Configuration: Update and verify the load balancer settings in a staging environment before deploying to production.
Monitor Traffic Distribution: Set up real-time monitoring and alerts for traffic distribution across servers.
Implement Change Management: Introduce a change management process requiring approvals for critical infrastructure changes.
Regular Configuration Audits: Conduct audits to ensure best practices in load balancer configurations.
